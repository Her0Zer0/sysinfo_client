## System Information Client

### Overview

sysinfo_client is built as a GUI for standard viewing of system information on the installed client. 
This eventually will become an electron application for distribution to other platforms. At the moment, the 
goal of this particular project is the desktop-style application alone. However, later features should include
a secure API to also pull this information across a SOHO network to a command center application.
